"""
Finds and deletes old, unmatched platform transfer transactions.

A transaction is considered for deletion if it meets the following criteria:
- The transaction date is more than 15 days ago.
- It is not linked to any bank transaction (related_bank_transaction is empty or null).
- The transfer is from a 'betting bank account' to a 'betting paypal account'.

This script runs in a "dry run" mode by default, printing the transactions
that would be deleted. Use the --execute flag to perform the deletion.
